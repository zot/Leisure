# The Leisure Initiative: Functional.  Lazy.  Accessible.  Powerful.

# Leisure: a convenient, untyped, lazy Lambda Calculus-based programming language with metaprogramming

Leisure is a convenient language for people's use and experimentation that you can easily tailor to your own needs.

One of the major goals of the Leisure initiative is to make learning and doing functional programming as easy as possible.

## Convenient
Leisure provides a convenient syntax and powerful tools to help people try things out quickly, be productive, and customize the language to suit their needs.  Leisure's syntax is based on Lambda Calculus and borrows things from Haskell and other languages while still remaining very small.  It also includes metaprogramming facilities to allow powerful customization.

### Lambdas
As in Haskell, you can write lambda either as ùõå or \.  Lambdas are structured as: **ùõå variable . body** and if you provide serveral space-separated variables, Leisure automatically constructs nested lambdas for you, like this: **\a b . a**

### Function definitions
You define a function with a declaration, an '=', and a body, like this: **true = \a b . a**.  You may place arguments before the '=' and omit the '\' and '.', like this: **true a b = a**.  Leisure automatically builds the lambda and associates it with the name you specified.

Leisure allows some simplistic parser tweaks; you can define tokens, so you can leave out spaces, and you can define tokens that open and close groups.

### Curly braces
Curly braces produce in-line groups, separated by semicolons, so instead of **(a (b c) (d e f) g)**, you could say: **a {b c; d e f} g** (or **{a;b c;d e f;g}**, etc.).

### Indentation
Leisure supports Python-style indentation, which it replaces with curly braces and semicolons during parsing.  Indented lines are considered to be part of the preceding overhanging line and each indented line produces a parenthesized group, so this:

<b><big><pre>
do  
  n <- prompt "What is your name? "  
  a <- prompt (concat ["Hello, ", n, ", thank you for joining us.  How old are you?"])
  seconds = * a 31536000
  print (concat ["You have been alive more than ", seconds, " seconds."])
</pre></big></b>

is equivalent to this: **do {n <- prompt "What is your name? "; print (concat ["Hello, ", n, ", thank you for joining us."])}**

and this:

<pre><b><big>
let
  a = 3
  b = + a 1
  a = * a b
  [a, b]
</big></b></pre>

is equivalent to this: **let {a <- 3; b <- + a 1; a <- * a b; [a, b]}**

## Notebook Style Interactive Development

For decades, programming has been done primarily in glorified text editors.  Some great strides have been made in various IDEs, but typically the programmer is still burdened with a neverending "write, compile, debug, test, repeat" development cycle.  Why do you keep settling for this when clearly we can do better?

While still heavily under development, Leisure is meant to push the envelope here and provide a fully interactive development environment where your code is executed and errors show while you're writing it. Functional programming is quite foreign to new comers, but what if you could instantly view the parse tree of the line of code you wrote? Or specify test arguments to your function and see the results live as you make changes to your code in real time?  Our goal is to show programmers there has to be a better way, and we've settled for the status quo for far too long.

## Untyped
Leisure is untyped.  This doesn't mean that Leisure is type-free, it just means that variables don't have types -- they can hold anything.  Leisure does have data types -- e.g. you can tell if something is a cons-cell (**is (cons 1 nil) cons** returns **true**).  Whenever you define a function that returns a lambda, it marks instances of that lambda as having the type of the definition.  For example, if you say:

**person name addr = \f . f name addr**

Then **(is (person a b) person)** will return **true** and **(getType (person a b))** will return **some person** (an option).  **(getType \x . x)**, however, will return none, because naked lambdas have no type (at this point, anyway).

## Lazy
Leisure is lazy.  It doesn't allow side effects, not because side effects are somehow *evil*, but because in a lazy language, side effects can lead to very strange behavior that's very hard to diagnose.  The idea is to have side effects outside the Leisure environment and access them using standard functional techniques, like monads and FRP.

## Metaprogramming
Leisure provides several tools for metaprogramming:

Functions
* getType data -- returns an option with the type of the data (or none if it has no type)
* is data type -- returns a boolean indicating whether data is of the type
* eq a b -- returns a boolean indicating whether a and b are identically equal
* parse string -- returns an AST for the string
* eval AST -- evaluates AST

Macros
* declaration =M= definition -- declares a macro that runs at parse-time.  Input is the AST for the macro expression and output is a new AST to replace the old one.  Further macro replacement is done on the result.  The identity macro is: **identMacro ast =M= ast**.
* Do and let are macros
   * let uses = to assign (and reassign) variables and returns the result of an expression using those variables (deprecated)
   * do uses = like let and uses <- to bind monads

## AST Function usage
lit v -- a literal value  
ref v -- a variable reference: v should be a string  
lambda var body -- a lambda: var should be a string or number, body is an AST  
apply func arg -- a function application: func can be any AST function except a _prim  

## AST Function definitions

lit x = \f . f x  
ref x = \f . f x  
lambda v f = \g . g v f  
apply func arg = \f . f func arg  

## Installing it

Obviously being hosted on GitHub, installing Leisure requires you to have a Git account and git client installed first. After that, simply clone the repo:

>git clone https://your_name@github.com/zot/Leisure.git


## Running it
### Running the REPL
>node runRepl

Runs the read eval print loop.  You can enter Leisure expressions and definitions there.

### Compiling files
>node runRepl -c [-v] file1 file2 ...

Compiles files.  You can optionally add -v to activate verbose mode where it will display each function name as it's being compiled.  You do not need to add the file extentions, eg. node runRepl maps

### Running the tests
To run the tests, you can cd into the top level directory and type
> node testLeisure

It should give you something like this:
> Running Tests...
> ...
> Done
> Succeeded all 40 tests.

Each . on the second line represents a successfully completed test.  If there are errors, it will tell you which tests failed.

## Changing it
If you want to change things, you'll probably want to change the CoffeeScript files, rather than their corresponding JavaScript.  The [build](build) file that contains a command to rebuild it, which is just
> node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee -c leisure.cs repl.cs runRepl.cs

## Implementation
Leisure is written in JavaScript and runs in node or in browsers.  Later, Leisure may generate native code, using, for instance, C and/or LLVM.  An LLVM version could use the VMKit‚Äôs garbage collector or the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector, which performs well with small objects (like function contexts).
